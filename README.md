TODO: 
- Write full docs on each protein and why
- Explain cloning strategy in full
- Get consistent synthesis fixing of proteins
- Replace pfu-sso7d with phusion

TEV came from https://www.addgene.org/8827/
p50-T4 came from https://www.addgene.org/87742/
phusion came from https://benchling.com/s/seq-YMXiaSNd56oDBcy530fB/edit

- Most proteins in this set have N terminal his tags, so we're just going to use that for BsaI and XbaI
